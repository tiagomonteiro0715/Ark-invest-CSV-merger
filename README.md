### My motivation for the creation of this software

The motivation behind this project was to help a family member. Who wanted to merge multple files from ____ holdings to gain a better insight of what ark invests has its money in. Another motivation for this was to get a better understanding of python and its build in modules. Image of one of the files

### How this program works?

![finances image](https://github.com/tiagomonteiro0715/Ark-invest-CSV-merger/blob/main/program%20diagram.png)

Basicaaly, all csv files wanted to merge are placed on a paste, then you click on the program exe file to run the program. Eventually another folder appears to remove the file merged. This new file containes all companies market value and shares merged. ADD HERE IMAGE.  And then the user needs to delete all folders. The program was build in this way to be as simple as possible. 

### My mistakes while completing it and ideas when strating its creation
I though of doing a GUI with the kivy module, where the user would drag and drop the files and essencially would nicely convert the files. But duo to a lack of time, interest and a fear of my family member not using it well. I decided not to use it. During the completion of this project I made two serious mistakes: Did not use tests while writing the code and declared variables that should only be repeated once. I wished I had made a good installer and fixed some possible bugs that could apper ond´ce a user uses the program. For example, how would the program handles files that are not in .csv type? What would it do if the .csv files didn´t have the right collumns for the program to work. at the moment, the program just  crashes.


### How the creation of this program improved me?
With this project I seriously improved my programming skills. One thing is coding, other is writing actually software. If coding is writing a page, I leaned the basics of writing a book. i learned how to do tests with the unittesting module. I gain a better understanding of pandas and numpy.

### How this project stands out?

This programming projects stands out by being just very simple to use. This way, people that lack the besic knowledje of computers can use it easily.

### Final notes

This  might be bad because I did it in a way to be as simple as possible to use and because I was 18. At the time I barely knew how to program. I only knew some programming languages and some python modules. if you can help me get a better project,, send me a message in github :)
