The motivation behind this project was to help a family member. Who wanted to merge multple files from ____ holdings to gain a better insight of what ark invests has its money in. Another motivation for this was to get a better understanding of python and its build in modules. Image of one of the files

Basicaaly, all csv files wanted to merge are placed on a paste, then you click on the program exe file to run the program. Eventually another folder appears to remove the file merged. This new file containes all companies market value and shares merged. ADD HERE IMAGE.  And then the user needs to delete all folders. The program was build in this way to be as simple as possible. I though of doing a GUI, where the user would drag and drop the files and essencially would nicely convert the files. But duo to a lack of time, interest and a fear of my family member not using it well. I decided not to use it. 

With this project I seriously improved my programming skills. One thing is coding, other is writing actually software. If coding is writing a page, I leaned the basics of writing a book. 
i learned how to do tests with the unittesting module. I gain a better understanding of pandas and numpy. ADD LINKS TO MODULES DOCSLearned more about writing clean code from THIS FILE. - https://github.com/julkwel/clean-code -

to add:

i planed to use kivy, but I was bored and the program was going to be transmitted through a pen drive
it might be bad because I did it in a way to be as simple as possible and because I was 18. still I made tests with the unitesting modules.

I declared files that choode not had been repeated
if you can help me get a better one, send me a message in github :)

create diagram with files path and what each file does. talking about the boring unittests. get where one to prove i actually used it. say I only started using at the end. A big mistake. each file - create a block

change name of program
section:
explain file tree  and a diagram with the program process
click here to install the actual program
click here to downloas source

write short blocks of text
make video showing the program for the zero. from the instalattion to the file creation and folder removal

talk about ark invest
criar indice com tudo e descrição muito breve.

a very briefe description of my licence and show site with other licenes easily explained
