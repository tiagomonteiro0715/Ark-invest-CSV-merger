### What this program is about?

CSV([Comma-separated values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values#Example)) file merger. 

![Diagram explaning my program](https://github.com/tiagomonteiro0715/Ark-invest-CSV-merger/blob/main/diagram-explaining-program.png)

It only mergers funds holdings csv files from the investement management firm [ark-invest](https://ark-funds.com/)

### What is ark invest?

[Ark invest](https://ark-invest.com/) is an investment fund that focuses on disrupting technologies. A few examples include artificial intelligence, DNA sequence, robotics, and 3D printing


ARK Invest manages many exchange-traded funds, such as: 
1. [Autonomous Technology & Robotics](https://ark-invest.com/strategy/autonomous-tech-robotics/)
3. [Genomic Revolution](https://ark-invest.com/strategy/genomic-revolution/)
4. [Israel Innovative Technology](https://ark-invest.com/strategy/israel-innovation/)

### How to use it?
the csv can be found here. - put link here
take screenshot of it

make video of me using it


To increase as much as possible the simplicity of the program and due to boredom of learning the python kivy module, I decided not to create a GUI for this program.


### How this program works?

![finances image](https://github.com/tiagomonteiro0715/Ark-invest-CSV-merger/blob/main/program%20diagram.png)

### My motivation

The purpose of the program was to improve my programming skills and also to help out  a relative who wanted to combine multiple csv files in order to gain a deeper understanding of what ark invests in. 


### My main mistake(s) and what can still be improved

Until now, my main mistake where: 
1. Not use unittests while writing the functions 
2. Declared variables that should only be repeated once.

Create a good installer to automatically install files

Stop being depedent on the pandas and numpy modules

Fix possible bugs. For example, how would the program handles files that are not in .csv type? What would it do if the .csv files didn´t have the right collumns for the program to work. at the moment, the program just crashes.

Create text to assure the user that the program is running. add animations to the command line of the program

Do a video explining how the program works. From download to download of csv files and others

### What I learned

With this project I seriously improved my programming skills. One thing is coding, other is writing actually software. If coding is writing a page, I leaned the basics of writing a book. i learned how to do tests with the unittesting module.

I also learned how to use the unittesting modulo. But I only started using it at the end. Due to boredom, I did not fully testes my code.

I gain a better understanding of pandas and numpy. ADD LINKS TO MODULES DOCSLearned more about writing clean code from THIS FILE. - https://github.com/julkwel/clean-code - 
Other modules include: ADD LINKS TO DOCS
os
shutil
datetime

### How this project stands out?

This programming projects stands out by being just very simple to use. This way, people that lack the besic knowledje of computers can use it easily. This project can become independent of numpy and pandas

### Final notes

This  might be bad because I did it in a way to be as simple as possible to use and because I was 18. At the time I barely knew how to program. I only knew some programming languages and some python modules. if you can help me get a better project,, send me a message in github :)

## To install:

### Install program files:

### Install source code and dependencies:

```
pip install --upgrade --user pip

pip install --upgrade virtualenv
```

Create and activate the virtual enviroment.The python version already needs to be installed in your pc

Activate it:

```
cd envname/Scripts

activate
```

Install necessary modules and activate it

```
pip install numpy pandas
```
