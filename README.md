The motivation behind this project was to gain a better understanding of tensorflow 2.4 and to serve as an example for future projects of the same type. 

Essencially, it takes a dataset of images builds a model that classifies brain images with and without cancer. I used tensorflow because it was, in my point of view, the best machine lerning framework for programming enthusiasts in this subfield.

Not only I lerned alot about this framework, but also learned in a pratical way machine lerning. This projects standout by the code being writeen in a way that is easy to understand. And also creates a model that is easy and intuitive  to use. 


Install dependencies:

```

Create and activate the virtual enviroment.The python version already needs to be installed in your pc

to add:

i planed to use kivy, but I was bored and the program was going to be transmitted through a pen drive
it might be bad because I did it in a way to be as simple as possible and because I was 18. still I made tests with the unitesting modules.

I declared files that choode not had been repeated
if you can help me get a better one, send me a message in github :)
